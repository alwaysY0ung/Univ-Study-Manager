# Univ-Study-Manager

In order to create a program to be used together, our team designed a "Univ-Study-Manager" learning management program that contains team members' academic management know-how.  

This program revolves around the class database and the task database.
The two databases receive and store their lecture information and assignment information, respectively,
Based on this information, you can efficiently check the lecture information you need to know today, as well as the upcoming tasks and tasks.

It also provides a function to calculate semester grades by entering corresponding grades for assignments and tests, and to analyze the trends in grades or types of tasks with high achievements through statistics. 
This will help users set their learning direction.

In addition, it works with the Google Calendar API to help users manage their schedules comprehensively,
It also has a function to help strengthen understanding on its own through learning in a way that uses the NLP API to explain directly to the other person.

We believe that these functions will ensure the convenience of schedule management and will be of practical help in improving grades and learning efficiency.
